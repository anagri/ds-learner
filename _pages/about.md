Hello,

Welcome to blog of my Data Science journey.

My name is Amir, you can find my professional experience details on my [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/anagri) profile.

I have a passion for data science, and have been on a self learning journey for over a decade. 

I started off my data science journey in 2011 with completing ai-class.com (now known as [udacity](https://udacity.com)) and ml-class.com (now known as [coursera.org](https://coursera.org))

I never transitioned into a full time data scientist, as I enjoy Software and Application Development ðŸ˜‚.

Since last year (jan 2021), I have deep dived into NLP and hoping to build some creative apps utilizing my wide experience in varied technology fields.

Feel free to connect and drop me a message on LinkedIn.
